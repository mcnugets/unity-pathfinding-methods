<p align = "justify"> This project includes number of basic functions of ai pathfinding methods. These methods are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijktra algorithm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"> A star algorithm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm"> Greedy Algorithm</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">Breadth First Search</a>. The basic pathfinding algorithms were implemented for the purpose of providing foundation for further game development. For this reason, current project involves number of implemented function that helps Agent(AI) to operate accordingly within the game. This Program perform operations like:</p>
  
<ul>
<li><strong>Patroling</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Chasing a Player</strong></li>
</ul>	

<p>In order for for Agent to patrol, program requires to place patrloling point throuhout the area. The moment these points are placed the agent will choose the closest point posible and will start moving accordingly. If player is within the detected range the agent switches to the chase, it switches back to patroling if player exits its range of view.</p>
<p>
This demo project still requires further improvement. :smiley:
